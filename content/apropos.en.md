hello ! 
  
My name is Kim, i'm a female statistician and I love doing R when I'm lonely at home. 
  
The objective of this blog is to share with you my R discoveries when I have time (some periods are more effective than others) and talk about developers or reseachers works and there super cool packages that I find interesting. I also love open data so I may also indicate some cool data to manipulate. And who knows, maybe you will find some of my own pieces of code useful ? :)

  My resume:

Have a nice visite !
