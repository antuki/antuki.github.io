<p>After <strong>5 years of professional experience in official statistics</strong>, I am back in school to complete my training to become a Senior Officer for the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE), after recently passing the internal competitive exam.</p>
<p>I am looking for a <strong>10-12-week summer internship in Data Science between June 1st and September 25th, 2020</strong> starting in June 2020 to improve and further develop my knowledge in IT implementation of statistical methods and tools.</p>
<p>My dream would be to do it <strong>outside Europe</strong>. Iâ€™m not exclusively looking for a paid internship. However if I could have a financial assistance (especially for the visa, trip and the accommodation), it would be really helpful.</p>
<p>To fulfill the requirements of the school where Iâ€™m studying (<a href="https://www.ensae.fr/en/">ENSAE Paris</a>), I just have to <strong>apply statistical methods</strong> based on the teachings of the school, which means it can cover a <strong>large scope of topics</strong>.</p>
<p>I mainly have experience in <strong>spatial analysis, opinion polls and datavisualisation</strong>. These skills can be enforced during the internship, but Iâ€™m very flexible and open to work in other areas.</p>
<p>Passionate about <strong>open data and open source</strong>, in addition to going to meetings such as <strong><span class="citation">@RLadiesParis</span></strong> or <strong><span class="citation">@ParisRAddict</span></strong>, Iâ€™ve also worked on different personal projects using <strong>R (statistical software)</strong>. My three main open source projects are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://dataviz.drees.solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/Barometre-DREES/"><strong>R Shiny Web application</strong></a>: interactive graphs of the French Opinion Barometer results. </br></br></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/antuki/COGugaison"><strong>COGugaison</strong></a>: R package for manipulating French spatial databases produced at different dates. </br></br></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/antuki/CARTElette"><strong>CARTElette</strong></a>: R package for creating geographical layers that correspond to the situation of the division of the French territories of each year.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is my resume: <a href="https://antuki.github.io/slides/CV/CV4.html">HTML</a> / <a href="https://antuki.github.io/slides/CV/CV_ANTUNEZ_online.pdf">PDF</a></p>
<p><strong>Thank you</strong> for all the advice you could give me for this search!</p>
