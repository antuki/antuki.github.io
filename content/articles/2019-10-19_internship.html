<p>After 5 years of professional experience in official statistics, I am back in school to complete my training to become a Senior Officer for the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE), after recently passing the internal competitive exam.</p>
<p>I am looking for a <strong>10-12-week summer internship in Data Science</strong> starting in June 2020 to improve and further develop my knowledge in IT implementation of statistical methods and tools. My dream would be to do it outside Europe.</p>
<p>Passionate about open data and open source, Iâ€™ve worked on different personal projects using R (statistical software). My three main open source projects are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://dataviz.drees.solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/Barometre-DREES/"><strong>R Shiny Web application</strong></a>: interactive graphs of the French Opinion Barometer results. </br></br></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/antuki/COGugaison"><strong>COGugaison</strong></a>: R package for manipulating French spatial databases produced at different dates. </br></br></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/antuki/CARTElette"><strong>CARTElette</strong></a>: R package for creating geographical layers that correspond to the situation of the division of the French territories of each year.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is my resume: <a href="https://antuki.github.io/slides/CV/CV4.html">HTML</a> / <a href="https://antuki.github.io/slides/CV/CV_ANTUNEZ_online.pdf">PDF</a></p>
