A small message in the night to share my happy mood of having a new blog which does not seem so bad after all.

And which allows me to create posts in a very simple way from R. 

Like that i'm showing you for example the very trendy viridis palette and what we call violin diagram (kind of boxplot but much more better).

```{r fig_en, eval=T}
library(ggplot2)
library(viridis)
head(ToothGrowth)
ToothGrowth$dose <- as.factor(ToothGrowth$dose)
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x=dose, y=len, fill=dose)) +   geom_violin() + scale_x_discrete() + coord_flip()+scale_fill_manual(values=viridis(3))
```
