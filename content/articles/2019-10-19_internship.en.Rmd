After **5 years of professional experience in official statistics**, I am back in school to complete my training to become a Senior Officer for the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE), after recently passing the internal competitive exam.

I am looking for a **10-12-week summer internship in Data Science between June 1st and September 25th, 2020** starting in June 2020 to improve and further develop my knowledge in IT implementation of statistical methods and tools. 

My dream would be to do it **outside Europe**. I'm not exclusively looking for a paid internship. However if I could have a financial assistance (especially for the visa, trip and the accommodation), it would be really helpful.

To fulfill the requirements of the school where I'm studying ([ENSAE Paris](https://www.ensae.fr/en/)), I just have to **apply statistical methods** based on the teachings of the school, which means it can cover a **large scope of topics**.
 
I mainly have experience in **spatial analysis, opinion polls and datavisualisation**. These skills can be enforced during the internship, but I'm very flexible and open to work in other areas.

Passionate about **open data and open source**, in addition to going to meetings such as **@RLadiesParis** or **@ParisRAddict**, Iâ€™ve also worked on different personal projects using **R (statistical software)**. My three main open source projects are:

 - [**R Shiny Web application**](http://dataviz.drees.solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/Barometre-DREES/): interactive graphs of the French Opinion Barometer results. </br></br>
 - [**COGugaison**](https://github.com/antuki/COGugaison):  R package for manipulating French spatial databases produced at different dates. </br></br>
 - [**CARTElette**](https://github.com/antuki/CARTElette): R package for creating geographical layers that correspond to the situation of the division of the French territories of each year.

Here is my resume: [HTML](https://antuki.github.io/slides/CV/CV4.html)  / [PDF](https://antuki.github.io/slides/CV/CV_ANTUNEZ_online.pdf)
 

**Thank you** for all the advice you could give me for this search!
