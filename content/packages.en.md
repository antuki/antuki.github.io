[COGugaison](https://antuki.github.io/COGugaison/) : an R package for manipulating french spatial databases produced at different dates

The administrative divisions of France (communes – counties – regions, departments…) change over time. Every year, some french territories change their codes, or names, merge or divide.

The COGugaison R package is based on the french official geographic code (COG) produced each year by the french National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (Insee). It has the objective of manipulating spatial databases produced at different dates by providing the list of existing towns and their history since fifty years and useful functions for transforming databases into geographic codes of other years.

This package is new and only documented in french. It is not completed and needs to be tested by users of French spatial databases.
